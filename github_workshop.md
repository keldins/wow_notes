## Standards
* Even if you are an official collaborator on a project, you probably shouldn't directly commit to the master branch
  * Instead, you ought to make a pull request so that everyone is fairly warned of your changes and there's official feedback

## Stuff to look into more
* Continuous integration
  * Travis? Free?


## Other
* Suppose you fork someone else's project. Say they're named Alice. If you make a pull request to Alice's repo, Alice has the ability to commit directly to *your* fork of their code.
  * It's not clear, but possible, that Alice always retains the ability to commit to your fork, even without a pull request.
